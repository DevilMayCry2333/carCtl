树莓派小车控制代码
采用ionic 5开发,服务端代码在server/b2.py。
服务端采用Flask框架。通过http来控制gpio的电平来控制小车的移动，舵机的转动等。

树莓派配合这个搭建起来的。

Raspberry Pi car control code
Developed with ionic 5, server code is at server / b2.py.
The server uses the Flask framework. The level of gpio is controlled by http to control the movement of the car, the rotation of the steering gear, etc.

The Raspberry Pi was built with this in mind.
